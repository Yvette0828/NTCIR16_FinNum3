Asia Pacific sales were up 43% or about $500 million driven primarily by China where we are seeing continued investment in building construction and infrastructure. Sales of excavators in China remained strong in the second quarter with industry sales for the 10-ton and above excavator up more than 70% year-to-date. North America also continued to be a bright spot for CI in the quarter with sales up about $400 million or 18%. Much of the sales increase was driven by investment in nonresidential construction and oil and gas-related projects including pipelines. Segment profit increased 28% over the last year to $1.2 billion which is a record for CI. And operating margin in the quarter was 18.7% exceeding the Investor Day range. Higher sales volume was the primary driver of the profit improvement. This was partially offset by unfavorable price realization and higher cost for material freight as well as SG&A and R&D. Pricing was competitive in the second quarter especially in some of our key regions for CI.

We're testing learning and optimizing at an incredible pace. But the real key is to turn these new digital capabilities into growth at scale. There's a lot to talk about here and I'll highlight a few areas that are leading to broad-based growth. First we're supercharging NikePlus membership for even greater personalization with consumers. When we offer more tailored product and experiences we bring more value to the consumer and it opens up more opportunities to grow our business. So this quarter we extended a new advanced algorithm in our apps that allows us to reward our most active members. We added this data driven format to the release of the Nike App in Japan and it helped lead to the most successful launch ever. We continue to show how important membership is to creating an increasingly seamless physical to digital retail experience. In our House of Innovation stores in New York and Shanghai over 50% of transactions are with members.

At the factory level that means staging raw materials so they can be quickly deployed to fill requests for our most in-demand products. We did this in anticipation of LeBron's move to a new team last summer and it cut our jersey lead times nearly in half. Expect more of that with all the high profile free agency moves this summer.

This quarter one of our greatest growth opportunities our women's offense experienced an important inflection point. I was fortunate enough to join our team in Paris for a powerful launch for the upcoming Women's World Cup where we hosted some of the greatest athletes in the world. We were excited to unveil 14 National Team kits for World Cup 2019 a tournament record for NIKE. And that energy of the moment is building on our Dream Crazier Just Do It campaign as narrated by Serena Williams. The campaign is a great example of how NIKE is leveraging the power of social media platforms to carry our message. Dream Crazier has broken several of our own consumer engagement records across all 4 geographies. For example in North America it's NIKE's most shared Instagram post ever and one of the most successful NIKE tweets of all time. In Greater China the campaign reached 600 million views in just the first 3 days.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion. In December we entered into a definitive agreement with GSK under which we have agreed to create a new Consumer Healthcare joint venture. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2019 subject of course to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals.\": defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'relative': [{'target_num': '6', 'offset_start': 181, 'offset_end': 182, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '9', 'offset_start': 510, 'offset_end': 511, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '32', 'offset_start': 615, 'offset_end': 617, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '18', 'offset_start': 1576, 'offset_end': 1578, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '33', 'offset_start': 2848, 'offset_end': 2850, 'claim': 0}], 'product number': [{'target_num': '13', 'offset_start': 313, 'offset_end': 315, 'claim': 0}], 'date': [{'target_num': '2018.', 'offset_start': 431, 'offset_end': 436, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '2018', 'offset_start': 542, 'offset_end': 546, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '2019', 'offset_start': 3310, 'offset_end': 3314, 'claim': 0}], 'money': [{'target_num': '4.1', 'offset_start': 570, 'offset_end': 573, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '1', 'offset_start': 1673, 'offset_end': 1674, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '1.8', 'offset_start': 2870, 'offset_end': 2873, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '3.4', 'offset_start': 3452, 'offset_end': 3455, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '3.6', 'offset_start': 3564, 'offset_end': 3567, 'claim': 0}], 'quantity_relative': [{'target_num': '50', 'offset_start': 654, 'offset_end': 656, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '90', 'offset_start': 1475, 'offset_end': 1477, 'claim': 0}, {'target_num': '35', 'offset_start': 2990, 'offset_end': 2992, 'claim': 0}], 'quantity_absolute': [{'target_num': '200000', 'offset_start': 1100, 'offset_end': 1106, 'claim': 0}], 'other': [{'target_num': '3', 'offset_start': 2254, 'offset_end': 2255, 'claim': 0}]}), 'Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health.

To deliver these innovations we have taken steps to ensure we have the right organizational structure in place and that our resources are focused in the right areas. To improve operational effectiveness and create capacity for value-creating work we have reorganized our operations to simplify them. We are initiating an enterprise-wide digital effort to speed up drug development enhance patient and physician experiences and access and leverage technology and robotics to simplify and automate our processes. And we are significantly reallocating capital across the enterprise by investing more aggressively in profitable growth drivers and reducing resources in areas of lower strategic importance. This includes significant planned reductions in indirect SI&A spending much of which will be reallocated to R&D. And within R&D the entire increase in spending will be project related with overhead costs actually anticipated to come down.
